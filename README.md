### What I learned

I learn how to do the responsive layout properly.
1. At beginning, the web is responsive.
2. Don't set `height`, if you need it, you could use `min-height`. The perfect way is using `padding`
3. Using relative units more, not fixed.
4. Let browser calculate, decide.
5. The media query is based on content, not device.
6. Less code would be better for management.

- [Why Is CSS So Weird?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUtMbJw8iA) - This was heard in above video. It really explains why CSS is so weird.
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - It helps me for choosing the fluid typography and fluid space to `margin` or `padding`.
